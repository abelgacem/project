create a documentation hub

# Purpose

- Define a single point of reference for all type of documentation (eg. Math, IT, physics, ...).
- Unify the Writing: Standardize the creation of all documentation to ensure a cohesive approach across technical guides, user manuals, project specifications, and policies, etc.
- Author documentation once in English and enable readers to access it in any language.
- leverages the full capabilities of a Git repository and codebase (release, collaboration, review, ...).
- Implement automation for generating cross-references between related documents within the hub, improving navigation and context for users.
- Establish clear learning paths for users to explore:
  - Processes
  - Topics within specific domains
  - Tutorials
